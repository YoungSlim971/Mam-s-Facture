**Legend:**
- ✅ PASSED (Not used as tests were skipped)
- ❌ FAILED (Not used as tests were skipped)
- 🟡 UNKNOWN (Test written but execution skipped)
- 🔴 MISSING (Test not yet written for this feature)
- ⚪ N/A (Not Applicable)

## Bugs or Failures

Since test execution was skipped, no bugs or failures can be reported from E2E tests at this time.

**Potential Issue Identified During Setup:**
- The `dev` script in `frontend/package.json` initially included `yes | pnpm install`, which would slow down server startup for tests. This has been corrected to just `vite`.

## Screenshots and Logs

No screenshots or logs are available as test execution was skipped.

## Conclusion

E2E tests have been set up with Playwright, and initial tests for core navigation, client creation, and theme toggling have been written. However, due to skipped execution, the actual functionality of these features could not be verified. Further tests are needed to cover all specified UI functionalities, particularly around invoice management and remaining client operations.

The application's usability post-refactor cannot be fully confirmed without executing these tests.
